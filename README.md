# qrcode
Add these 2 files to the code.
Camera permission QR code will ask, but you can do that on the mail file too.
We can use permission_handler to manage permissions.
Write a code in the main class to handle permission before user goes to scan the QR code.
From the main class, you can navigate to QR code generator and scanner. 


It would help if you gave <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"  tools:ignore="PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware" /> in android manifest file
